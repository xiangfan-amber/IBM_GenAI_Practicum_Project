      "title": "Background",
      "content": "In October 2008, HHS issued the HHS OCIO Policy for Information Technology Enterprise Performance Life Cycle along with the EPLC Framework Overview Document that describes a structured approach to planning, managing, and overseeing HHS IT projects over their entire life cycle. The EPLC Policy, together with the EPLC Framework, serves as the authority for EPLC requirements, objectives, responsibilities, and standards for managing all IT projects at HHS. The EPLC Policy was revised in 2016 to incorporate project management elements of FITARA. Implementing the EPLC framework helps ensure the quality of HHS IT products through improved project management processes and accountability."

This policy shall be applied in conjunction with the HHS Policy for Enterprise Architecture (EA), Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), and Portfolio Management (PfM). OPDIVs and STAFFDIVs may create a more restrictive policy but not one that is less compliant than this Department Policy."
