# IBM_GenAI_Practicum_Project
In partnership with IBM through Columbia University’s QMSS Practicum, this project addressed the critical inefficiencies within the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC). Project managers currently face a heavy administrative burden, navigating over 50 mandatory templates with dense, overlapping policy requirements. This manual process often leads to redundant work, inconsistent terminology, and increased compliance risk.

To resolve these friction points, the team developed the EPLC Assistant, a Generative AI application powered by GPT-4o Mini. Utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture grounded in proprietary IBM data, the tool targets the four most complex project phases (Requirements, Design, Development, and Implementation). The system automates the drafting process, provides context-aware policy answers, and refines content via a custom web interface. Evaluations confirmed that the assistant significantly improves documentation clarity and helpfulness, ultimately reducing review times and operational risk.
